# Design note 003: the photo sidecar and the version sidecar

> **Status: proposal, awaiting approval.** Third design note of work package WP1
> ([M1 plan](../m1-plan.md) §5 and §6, items 4 and 8). It answers questions 4 and 26 of the
> specification (§10): what is written in a **photo sidecar** and a **version sidecar**, in which
> XMP properties, how keywords are referred to, how the version's copy of the photo's metadata
> stays consistent (D-027), and which metadata fields M1 supports. It builds on
> [note 001](001-workspace-layout.md) (where the files are and how they are written) and
> [note 002](002-state-files.md) (the state files). The content fingerprint and the relinking
> of files are note 004; the development chain and history are M2's. Items are **[proposed]**
> until approved; the approval becomes decision D-087.

## 1. The question

Two kinds of file carry the truth about a photo: the **photo sidecar** (the original's metadata,
D-023, and a cache of what was read from the original, D-074) and the **version sidecars** (a copy of
the photo's metadata, the version's own metadata, and the development, D-023 and D-027). The
specification fixes the principle: photo sidecars are standard XMP, readable by other software;
version sidecars are XMP if practical (§5.8). What exactly goes in them, and how, so that the
catalogue can be rebuilt without the originals, other software can read what it should, and nothing
we do not understand is lost?

## 2. Requirements

| # | Requirement | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The photo sidecar is **standard XMP**, and a foreign tool reading it finds rating, label, title, caption, keywords (flat and hierarchical), creator, rights and location in the places it expects. | Spec §5.7, §5.8 |
| 2 | It **caches the original's capture data** (time, camera, lens, exposure, size, GPS) so a rebuild never reopens the originals. | D-074 |
| 3 | **EXIF corrections are overlays**: the original value stays visible and can be restored. | Spec §5.7 |
| 4 | **Keywords have a stable identity** in the vocabulary; renaming or moving one updates every photo that uses it. | D-045 |
| 5 | A version sidecar is **self-contained**: it copies the photo's metadata and adds its own, and records **which fields it overrides**; when the photo changes, the copies **follow**, except for the overridden fields. | D-023, D-027, spec §5.5 |
| 6 | **Effective value** = the version's if it defines one, otherwise the photo's; keywords are the **union**; a version can only **add** keywords. | Spec §5.5, D-014 |
| 7 | **Existing XMP** files from other software are read (never modified) and their ratings and keywords are copied in; hierarchies written by other software are understood. | Spec §5.2, §5.7 |
| 8 | A file made by a **newer** Auroraw, or edited by another tool, keeps everything that is not understood. | Architecture §5.5 |
| 9 | A **rebuild** of 100,000 photos and their versions reads them all: parsing must be fast, in the order of tens of thousands of files a second on all cores. | D-026, spike 3 |
| 10 | The **write** of a single change stays one small file, and the version copies must not make an action in Cull mode slow. | Spec §9 |
| 11 | Privacy: the file paths of the original and private data stay in the workspace and are **not** part of what other software or an export receives. | D-046, D-047 |

## 3. The options for the file format

**A. XMP written and read by Auroraw's own code** on a general-purpose XML parser (`quick-xml`),
with a small model of the properties we know and an opaque copy of the rest. Full control
over canonical writing and preservation, no C++ build. The work is ours.

**B. The Adobe XMP Toolkit** (through the `xmp-toolkit` crate). The reference implementation, but
a large C++ library to build on three platforms and to package, for a use that is small and
well-defined. Rejected for the build and packaging cost, which is also why spike 4 used a Rust
decoder rather than LibRaw.

**C. Exiv2 or ExifTool** as a library or a subprocess. Exiv2 is GPL C++; ExifTool is Perl and a
subprocess per file. Rejected for speed and packaging (requirement 9); **ExifTool is used in the
tests** to check that what we write is read correctly.

**D. A JSON sidecar with an XMP export.** Simpler for us, and contrary to requirement 1 and to the
specification's promise of a standard XMP.

**Proposal: A.** Auroraw writes a **strict, canonical subset** of XMP and reads the **general
form**, since other software writes it in several equivalent ways (properties as attributes,
several `rdf:Description` blocks, `rdf:parseType="Resource"`).

## 4. The photo sidecar

### 4.1 Form [proposed]

- One `x:xmpmeta` with one `rdf:RDF` and **one `rdf:Description`**, inside the usual `<?xpacket?>`
  wrapper, UTF-8, LF, two-space indentation.
- **Every property as an element** (never as an attribute), in a **documented fixed order**, arrays
  as `rdf:Seq`, `rdf:Bag` or `rdf:Alt` as the XMP specification says. The same content gives the
  same bytes (as in note 002), so an unchanged sidecar is not rewritten.
- **Unknown properties** (other namespaces, or Auroraw properties from a newer version) are kept as
  opaque, namespace-correct subtrees and written after the known ones, in their original order.
  A second `rdf:Description` from another tool is merged into the model on reading and remembered as
  such, never lost.
- Times are ISO 8601, **with the UTC offset when it is known**; timestamps written by Auroraw are UTC.

### 4.2 The namespace [proposed]

Auroraw's own properties live in the namespace `https://auroraw.org/ns/1.0/`, prefix `aur`. The
address does not have to answer, but the project owns the domain (D-083) and a page describing the
schema can be published there. The version of this part of the file is `aur:Schema`, an integer
(note 002 rules apply: a newer schema is not modified).

### 4.3 What the photo sidecar contains [proposed]

| What | XMP property | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | `aur:PhotoId` | 32 hexadecimal characters (note 001). |
| **Schema** | `aur:Schema` | Integer. |
| **Rating** | `xmp:Rating` | Stars 0 to 5, always the stars. A rejected photo keeps its stars (see the flag). |
| **Flag** | `aur:Flag` | `picked`, `rejected`, or absent. |
| **Colour label** | `xmp:Label` | The label's name, as other software writes it. |
| **Title** | `dc:title` | Language alternative, `x-default`. |
| **Caption** | `dc:description` | Language alternative. |
| **Keywords, flat** | `dc:subject` | The **leaf** keywords assigned, by name. |
| **Keywords, hierarchy** | `lr:hierarchicalSubject` | Full paths with `|` (`Place|Canada|Quebec`), the form Lightroom, digiKam-compatible tools and others read. |
| **Keywords, identity** | `aur:KeywordIds` | A bag of the assigned keywords' identifiers (§6). |
| **Other metadata** | The list of §7 | Creator, rights, credit, location, and so on. |
| **The original's data**, as read | `exif:DateTimeOriginal` (with `exif:OffsetTimeOriginal` and the sub-seconds), `tiff:Make`, `tiff:Model`, `aux:SerialNumber`, `aux:Lens`, `exif:ExposureTime`, `exif:FNumber`, `exif:ISOSpeedRatings`, `exif:FocalLength`, `exif:FocalLengthIn35mmFilm`, `exif:PixelXDimension` and `exif:PixelYDimension`, `tiff:Orientation`, `exif:GPSLatitude`, `exif:GPSLongitude`, `exif:GPSAltitude` | The standard properties, **holding the original's values**, as XMP sidecars conventionally do (D-074). |
| **EXIF overlays** | `aur:Overlay` | A structure with the fields corrected: `CaptureTime`, `Gps` (latitude, longitude, altitude), `Camera`, `Lens`, `Orientation`. The effective value is the overlay's if present, otherwise the original's. |
| **The files of the photo** | `aur:Files` | A sequence, one entry per file: `Role` (`original` or `companion`, the JPEG of a RAW+JPEG pair, D-032), `Name`, `Format`, `Size`, `Hash`, and `Locations` (source identifier, path relative to the source, last seen). The content of `Hash` and the relinking are note 004. |
| **The main version** | `aur:MainVersion` | The identifier of the version the grid shows (D-063). |
| **Imported** | `aur:Imported` | UTC time of the first add. |

Roughly 3 KB for a photo with a dozen keywords. **The versions of a photo are not listed in its
sidecar**: they are the files `versions/<xx>/<photo id>.*.xmp` (adding a version does not rewrite the
photo sidecar, and a version created on another machine is found by the scan).

(The sketch is abridged; the full property order is in the schema page written with WP1.)

### 4.5 Rating, flags and the other software's convention [proposed]

Other software often encodes "rejected" as `xmp:Rating = -1`. Auroraw keeps **stars and flag apart**
(a rejected three-star photo keeps its three stars, spec §5.3), so the workspace sidecar carries the
stars in `xmp:Rating` and the flag in `aur:Flag`. The mapping is made at the **boundary**:

- **Reading foreign XMP**: `xmp:Rating = -1` becomes flag *rejected* with no stars; other values are stars.
- **The XMP export to the source folders** (D-024), where other software is the reader, offers to
  write `-1` for rejected photos, which loses the stars in that file and not in the workspace.

## 5. The version sidecar

### 5.1 What it contains [proposed]

| What | XMP property | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | `aur:VersionId`, `aur:PhotoId`, `aur:Schema` | |
| Name, creation time | `aur:Name`, `aur:Created` | |
| **The overridden fields** | `aur:Overrides` | A bag of the field names the version defines itself: `rating`, `flag`, `label`, `title`, `caption` (spec §5.5). Keywords are additive and are not in this list. |
| **The keywords it adds** | `aur:AddedKeywordIds` | Identifiers, as in the photo (a version can only add, D-014). |
| **The effective metadata** | The same properties as the photo sidecar (§4.3): rating, flag, label, title, caption, keywords (**the union**), the other fields of §7, the original's data and overlays | A **copy**, so the file is self-contained (D-023) and other software reading it sees the version's own metadata. For an overridden field it holds the version's value; for the others, the photo's. |
| **The provenance of the copy** | `aur:CopiedFrom` | A digest of the photo's metadata at the time of the copy (§5.3). |
| **The development** | `aur:Pipeline…` | Empty in M1: the chain, the history and the snapshots are written in M2 (§5.4). |

### 5.2 Which is the truth [proposed]

There are two copies of the same information, so the rule is written down: **the photo sidecar plus
the version's own overrides and additions are the truth; the copy in a version sidecar is derived.**
The effective value of a version is computed from them, and the copy is refreshed to match. If they
disagree (a crash, an edit by another tool), the truth wins and the copy is rewritten, never the other
way round. This is what lets D-027 ("the copies follow") be true without making the copies a second
source of truth.

### 5.3 How the copy follows, and what an action costs [proposed]

The digest in `aur:CopiedFrom` is a **BLAKE3 hash of the canonical form of the fields that are copied**
(the properties of §4.3 other than the identity, the files and the locations). The write path of
architecture §5.3 becomes:

1. Write the **photo sidecar** (atomic), then the database transaction. **This is all an action waits for.**
2. The version copies are refreshed **afterwards, in the background**, in one batch, for each version
   whose copy would change: the fields changed and not overridden by that version.
3. At start-up, and after a crash, the **reconcile** compares each version's `aur:CopiedFrom` with the
   photo's current digest and refreshes the ones that differ.

Rating a photo in Cull mode therefore writes one small file, whatever the number of its versions. A
batch edit of 10,000 photos with about 1.4 versions each rewrites 10,000 photo sidecars first
and about 14,000 version sidecars in the background: on NTFS about 0.7 ms per file (note 001),
7 s then 10 s, a job with progress that does not block the interface, run on several threads.

### 5.4 The development, reserved for M2 [proposed]

M1 writes no development. M2's note decides how the chain, the history and the snapshots are stored
(spec §10, questions 17 and 20): inside the XMP as a JSON value of `aur:Pipeline`, or in a companion
file, or both. **The room is reserved now**: `aur:PipelineSchema` is the version of that part, and a
companion file is named `<photo id>.<version id>.<suffix>` (for example `.history.json`), which is a
name an M1 reader lists as unknown and never touches (note 001 §5.6). A version with a development a
reader does not understand is opened **read-only for the development** and its metadata still works.

## 6. Keywords: identity and names [proposed]

- **A keyword is identified by its identifier** in the vocabulary (note 002); `aur:KeywordIds` in a
  sidecar says which keywords a photo has, and **the names in `dc:subject` and
  `lr:hierarchicalSubject` are a copy for other software**.
- **Vocabulary names cannot contain `|`** (the separator of the hierarchical form); the interface
  refuses it.
- **Renaming, moving or merging a keyword** changes the vocabulary file at once, which is the whole
  change for Auroraw: it displays and searches by identifier. The **name copies in the sidecars
  are refreshed in the background**, in one batch, like the version copies. A crash in the middle leaves
  some names stale, which affects only other software reading those files. At start-up, a
  refresh runs again if the vocabulary changed after the last completed one (a stamp in the local
  registry).
- **A keyword removed from the vocabulary** (merged or deleted) is replaced by its merge target, or
  removed from the photos in a batch, and the identifier is never reused.
- **Do-not-export keywords** (D-045) are written in the workspace, which is private, and **dropped
  from what leaves it**: exports and the XMP export to source folders (§8).
- **On rebuild**, an identifier found in the vocabulary wins; one not found is a **dangling keyword**,
  listed in a report and kept in the sidecar; a sidecar **without identifiers** (foreign, or written before
  the vocabulary existed) is resolved **by path**, creating the missing vocabulary entries.

## 7. The metadata fields of M1 [proposed]

Closes item 8 of the M1 plan (spec §10, question 26). The IPTC Core fields, a useful subset of the
IPTC Extension, and the XMP basics. **Custom fields are not in M1.** Overridable per version means
the version can hold its own value (spec §5.5); everything else is the photo's.

| Field | XMP property | Overridable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | `dc:title` | Yes |
| Caption | `dc:description` | Yes |
| Rating, colour label | `xmp:Rating`, `xmp:Label` | Yes |
| Flag | `aur:Flag` | Yes |
| Keywords | `dc:subject`, `lr:hierarchicalSubject`, `aur:KeywordIds` | Add only |
| Creator | `dc:creator` | No |
| Copyright | `dc:rights` | No |
| Usage terms, web statement | `xmpRights:UsageTerms`, `xmpRights:WebStatement` | No |
| Credit, source | `photoshop:Credit`, `photoshop:Source` | No |
| Headline, instructions | `photoshop:Headline`, `photoshop:Instructions` | No |
| Sublocation, city, region, country, country code | `Iptc4xmpCore:Location`, `photoshop:City`, `photoshop:State`, `photoshop:Country`, `Iptc4xmpCore:CountryCode` | No |
| Persons shown, event | `Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImage`, `Iptc4xmpExt:Event` | No |
| Original's capture data, overlays | §4.3 | No |

Location fields hold the text; the coordinates are the GPS of the original and its overlay. Reading
these from a **foreign XMP** (§8) uses the same properties, and also the older forms other software still writes.

## 8. What crosses the boundary [proposed]

The workspace sidecars are **private working files**, readable by other software, not what is handed
over. Three boundaries have their own mapping, made by the code that crosses them (WP7, WP10, M2):

| Boundary | What is done |
| --- | --- |
| **Reading foreign XMP** at import (Lightroom, darktable, digiKam, ExifTool; never modified) | Read: `xmp:Rating` (-1 is rejected), `xmp:Label`, `dc:subject`, `lr:hierarchicalSubject`, `digiKam:TagsList`, the title, caption, creator, rights and IPTC properties above. Ignored (and not copied): develop settings of other software, which are not portable (spec §5.8). Ratings and keywords are copied into the photo sidecar, and keywords are matched to the vocabulary **by path**. |
| **XMP export to the source folders** (D-024, D-028) | A **derived** file built from the photo sidecar: the effective EXIF values in the standard properties (overlays applied), `-1` for rejected if chosen, the **do-not-export keywords removed**, and **no `aur:Files`, locations or identifiers of Auroraw** other than the marker that lets Auroraw recognise its own export (D-047). |
| **Metadata in exported images** (D-046) | The effective metadata of the exported version according to the recipe: by default everything except the location and the camera's serial number, and never the do-not-export keywords, paths or workspace identifiers. |

## 9. Consequences for WP1

- The `format` crate holds the XMP model, the general **reader**, the strict canonical **writer**, and the
  mapping of §4.3 and §7, with **fixtures** for both sidecars (schema 1), including real XMP files from
  other software.
- **Tests**: round trip; canonical bytes; unknown properties, extra namespaces and second
  `rdf:Description` blocks kept; the attribute form and the element form read the same; a truncated or
  invalid file is an error and is never overwritten; a newer `aur:Schema` is not modified; **ExifTool reads the
  fixtures back correctly** (in CI); the digest of the copied fields is stable across platforms.
- A **parse benchmark** on 100,000 photo and 143,000 version sidecars, to hold requirement 9
  (tens of thousands of files a second on all cores), run on the three platforms.
- The schema is written as a short **public page** (in `docs/`, later on auroraw.org) so that other tools
  can read what is in a sidecar.

## 10. Not settled here

| Item | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The hash and the fingerprint in `aur:Files`, relinking, "original changed" | Note 004 |
| The development chain, the history, the snapshots | M2 |
| The merge of an external XMP change field by field (D-047) | WP10 |
| Whether a foreign tool that rewrites a workspace sidecar (it should not) is detected | WP10 |
| The exact property order and the full schema page | WP1 |

## 11. What is asked

Approval of: the choice of writing and reading XMP with our own code (§3); the form of §4.1 and the
namespace (§4.2); the content of the photo sidecar (§4.3) and the treatment of rating and flag (§4.5);
the content of the version sidecar and the rule that **the photo plus the version's overrides is the
truth and the copy is derived** (§5.1 to §5.3); the room reserved for the development (§5.4); the
treatment of keywords (§6); the field list of M1 (§7); and the boundaries (§8), as **D-087**.
The point most worth a second look is §5.3: **version copies are refreshed in the background**, which
is faster than writing them with every action, and slightly relaxes the letter of D-027 ("the copies
follow") into "the copies follow, shortly, and are repaired if a crash interrupts them".
