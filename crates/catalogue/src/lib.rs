//! The SQLite catalogue: an index over a workspace, entirely rebuildable from it (architecture
//! §5, D-026, D-073). This crate depends only on `format` and `types` (architecture §3.2): it
//! knows nothing about the workspace on disk. Its caller (the `workspace` crate's scan, later
//! the `engine`) reads sidecars and state files and hands them to [`rebuild_to_file`], or applies
//! incremental changes through [`Catalogue::apply_photo_metadata`] and
//! [`Catalogue::apply_keyword`].
//!
//! - [`open`] creates and opens a catalogue, with its migrations (`PRAGMA user_version`).
//! - [`rebuild`] builds a fresh catalogue file from a workspace's content, atomically.
//! - [`write`] applies a change to one photo's or one keyword's existing row (WP3's engine).
//! - [`query`] answers the questions the grid and the search panel ask, with keyset paging.
//! - [`reconcile`] says which sidecars the catalogue's copy no longer matches.
//! - [`effective`] computes the effective rating and flag a version's overrides give a photo
//!   (D-063).
//! - [`registry`] is the small, local, per-machine list of a person's catalogues (design note
//!   001 §5.7).
//! - [`dataset`] generates a synthetic but realistic catalogue for tests and benchmarks (moved
//!   here from spike 3, M1 plan WP2).
