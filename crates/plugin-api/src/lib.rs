//! This crate is licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0 so that a plugin, free or not, can include it
//! (decision D-080). It therefore depends on no crate of the application. The [`source`]
//! interface arrived first (WP4), since the core's own local-folder and removable-volume sources
//! need it before anything else here exists, and still runs as native code (architecture §8.6);
//! WP6 adds the declaration schema, permissions and [`decoder`], and productizes the wasmtime
//! host (`plugin-host`) that loads the first real sandboxed plugin. Experimental until milestone
//! M5 (architecture §8.2b): everything in this crate can change without a deprecation period.
