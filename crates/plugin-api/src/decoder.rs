//! The `Decoder` family's interface (architecture §8.1, row "Import": "pixels (linear), metadata,
//! embedded preview; RAW decoders"). WP6 gives this the same treatment WP4 gave [`crate::Source`]:
//! a plain trait a native implementation and a sandboxed WebAssembly one both satisfy, so the
//! host and its callers do not know which they are holding.
//!
//! This is narrower than `imaging`'s own decoding (WP5): `imaging::embedded_preview` reads the
//! small JPEG preview a camera already wrote, cheaply, for thumbnails. [`Decoder::decode`] is the
//! full decode to the sensor's own mosaic that spike 4 measured (`rawler`, native and as a
//! WebAssembly plugin, bit-identical): the source data a future develop pipeline demosaics and
//! renders (M2). The two live in different crates on purpose: `imaging` never needs a full decode
//! for a thumbnail, and this trait never needs `imaging`'s preview or colour handling.
