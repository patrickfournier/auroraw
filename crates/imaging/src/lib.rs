//! Decoders, embedded previews, thumbnails, the previews database and the preview colour
//! (architecture §3.1, §5.7, D-075). Work package WP5.
//!
//! Native code, dispatching by extension itself ([`format::is_standard`]), and stays that way:
//! WP6 added `plugin_api::Decoder`, but for the sensor's own mosaic (architecture §8.1, "Import:
//! pixels (linear)"), a full RAW decode this crate never needs for a cheap embedded-preview
//! thumbnail. The two are separate on purpose, not a promotion of this crate's own code.
//!
//! - [`read_metadata`] reads what a photo sidecar caches (design note 003 §4.3): camera, lens,
//!   exposure, capture time, GPS, as text in the shapes `auroraw_format::sidecar::Original`
//!   expects (this crate does not depend on `format`; the two are siblings under `engine`).
//! - [`embedded_preview`] decodes the image a thumbnail is made from: the file itself for a
//!   standard format, the largest embedded preview `rawler` can find for a RAW one.
//! - [`make_thumbnail`] resizes and encodes it, applying orientation first.
//! - [`perceptual_hash`] is a similarity fingerprint, computed alongside a thumbnail; WP9 decides
//!   what to do with it.
//! - [`PreviewsDb`] is the cache database thumbnails live in (D-075).
//!
//! Colour: an embedded preview is, in practice, always an sRGB JPEG already (what a camera's own
//! processor writes for its own LCD and for other software to show unmodified) — this crate
//! trusts that rather than building colour management for it. A wide-gamut embedded preview,
//! and a RAW file's own sensor data converted through a working space, both need the image
//! engine (M2); WP5 does not have one to convert through.
