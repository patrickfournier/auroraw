# Auroraw

Free and open source application for photographers: organise, develop (RAW files and film
negative scans, non-destructively), convert, edit metadata and deliver galleries.

> **Status: milestone M1 started.** The design is complete ([documents below](#documents)) and the
> repository has its product layout (work package WP0). There is nothing to install yet.

## Building

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` installs it on first use.

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo xtask check      # licence headers and the allowed dependencies between crates
```

The crates are described in the [architecture](docs/architecture.md) (§3). The code of the four
technical spikes is archived at the tag `spikes-final`.
